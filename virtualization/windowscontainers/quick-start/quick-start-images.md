# 自动生成和保存映像

In the previous Windows Server quick start, a Windows container was created from a pre-created .Net Core sample. This exercise will detail creating custom container images manually, automating container image creation using a Dockerfile, and storing container images in the Docker Hub public registry.

This quick start is specific to Windows Server containers on Windows Server 2016 and will use the Windows Server Core container base image. Additional quick start documentation can be found in the table of contents on the left hand side of this page.

**Prerequisites:**

- One computer system (physical or virtual) running Windows Server 2016.
- Configure this system with the Windows Container feature and Docker. For a walkthrough on these steps, see [Windows Containers on Windows Server](./quick-start-windows-server.md).
- A Docker ID, this will be used to push a container image to Docker Hub. If you do not have a Docker ID, sign up for one at [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/).

## 1. Container Image - Manual

For the best experience, walk through this exercise from a Windows command shell (cmd.exe).

The first step in manually creating a container image is to deploy a container. For this example, deploy an IIS container from the pre-created IIS image. Once the container has been deployed, you will be working in a shell session from within the container. The interactive session is initiated with the `-it` flag. For in depth details on Docker Run commands, see [Docker Run Reference on Docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). 

> This step may take some time due to the size of the Windows Server Core base image.

```none
docker run -d --name myIIS -p 80:80 microsoft/iis
```

Now, the container will be running in the background. The default command included in the container, `ServiceMonitor.exe`, which monitor IIS progress and automatically stop the container if IIS stops. To learn more on how this image was created, see [Microsoft/docker-iis](https://github.com/Microsoft/iis-docker) on GitHub.

Next, start an interactive cmd in the container. This will allow you to run commands in running container without stopping IIS or ServiceMonitor.

```none
docker exec -i myIIS cmd 
```

Next, you can make a change to the running container. Run the following command to remove the IIS splash screen.

```none
del C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm
```

And the following to replace the default IIS site with a new static site.

```none
echo "Hello World From a Windows Server Container" > C:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.html
```

From a different system, browse to the IP address of the container host. You should now see the ‘Hello World’ application.

**Note:** if you are working in Azure, a network security group rule will need to exist allowing traffic over port 80. For more information see, [Create Rule in a Network Security Group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-create-nsg-arm-pportal/#create-rules-in-an-existing-nsg).

Back in the container, exit the interactive container session.

```none
exit
```

The modified container can now be captured into a new container image. To do so, you will need the container name. This can be found using the `docker ps -a` command.

```none
docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID     IMAGE                             COMMAND   CREATED             STATUS   PORTS   NAMES
489b0b447949     microsoft/iis   "cmd"     About an hour ago   Exited           pedantic_lichterman
```

To create a the new container image, use the `docker commit` command. Docker commit takes a form of “docker commit container-name new-image-name”. Note – replace the name of the container in this example with the actual container name.

```none
docker commit pedantic_lichterman modified-iis
```

To verify that new image has been created, use the `docker images` command.  

```none
docker images

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
modified-iis        latest              3e4fdb6ed3bc        About a minute ago   10.17 GB
microsoft/iis       windowsservercore   c26f4ceb81db        2 weeks ago          9.48 GB
windowsservercore   10.0.14300.1000     dbfee88ee9fd        8 weeks ago          9.344 GB
windowsservercore   latest              dbfee88ee9fd        8 weeks ago          9.344 GB
```

This image can now be deployed. The resulting container will include all captured modifications.

## 2. Container Image - Dockerfile

Through the last exercise, a container was manually created, modified, and then captured into a new container image. Docker includes a method for automating this process using a Dockerfile. This exercise will have almost identical results as the last, however this time the process will be automated. For this exercise, a Docker ID is required. If you do not have a Docker ID, sign up for one at [Docker Cloud]( https://cloud.docker.com/).

On the container host, create a directory `c:\build`, and in this directory create a file named `Dockerfile`. Note – the file should not have a file extension.

```none
powershell new-item c:\build\Dockerfile -Force
```

Open the Dockerfile in notepad.

```none
notepad c:\build\Dockerfile
```

Copy the following text into the Dockerfile, and save the file. These commands instruct Docker to create a new image, using `microsoft/iis` as the base. The dockerfile then runs the commands specified in the `RUN` instruction, in this case the index.html file is updated with new content. 

For more information on Dockerfiles, see the [Dockerfiles on Windows](../manage-docker/manage-windows-dockerfile.md).

```none
FROM microsoft/iis
RUN echo "Hello World - Dockerfile" > c:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.html
```

The `docker build` command will start the image build process. The `-t` parameter instructs the build process to name the new image `iis-dockerfile`. **Replace 'user' with the user name of your Docker account**. If you do not have an account with Docker, sign up for one at [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/).

```none
docker build -t <user>/iis-dockerfile c:\Build
```

When completed, you can verify that the image has been created using the `docker images` command.

```none
docker images

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
iis-dockerfile      latest              8d1ab4e7e48e        2 seconds ago       9.483 GB
microsoft/iis       windowsservercore   c26f4ceb81db        2 weeks ago         9.48 GB
windowsservercore   10.0.14300.1000     dbfee88ee9fd        8 weeks ago         9.344 GB
windowsservercore   latest              dbfee88ee9fd        8 weeks ago         9.344 GB
```

Now, deploy a container with the following command, again replacing user with your Docker ID.

```none
docker run -d -p 80:80 <user>/iis-dockerfile ping -t localhost
```

Once the container has been created, browse to the IP address of the container host. You should see the hello world application.

![](media/dockerfile2.png)

Back on the container host, use `docker ps` to get the name of the container, and `docker rm` to remove the container. Note – replace the name of the container in this example with the actual container name.

Get container name.

```none
docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND               CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
c1dc6c1387b9   iis-dockerfile   "ping -t localhost"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   cranky_brown
```

Remove container.

```none
docker rm -f <container name>
```

## 3. Docker Push

Docker container images can be stored in a container registry. Once an image is stored in a registry, it can be retrieved for later use across many different container hosts. Docker provides a public registry for storing container images at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

For this exercise, the custom hello world image will be pushed to your own account on Docker Hub.

First, login to your docker account using the `docker login command`.

```none
docker login

Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.

Username: user
Password: Password

Login Succeeded
```

Once logged in, the container image can be pushed to Docker Hub. To do so, use the `docker push` command. **Replace 'user' with your Docker ID**. 

```none
docker push <user>/iis-dockerfile
```

The container image can now be downloaded from Docker Hub onto any Windows container host using `docker pull`. For this tutorial, we will delete the existing image, and then pull it down from Docker Hub. 

```none
docker rmi <user>/iis-dockerfile
```

Running `docker images` will show that the image has been removed.

```none
docker images

REPOSITORY                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
modified-iis              latest              51f1fe8470b3        5 minutes ago       7.69 GB
microsoft/iis             latest              e4525dda8206        3 hours ago         7.61 GB
```

Finally, docker pull can be used to pull the image back onto the container host. Replace user with the user name of your Docker account. 

```none
docker pull <user>/iis-dockerfile
```
